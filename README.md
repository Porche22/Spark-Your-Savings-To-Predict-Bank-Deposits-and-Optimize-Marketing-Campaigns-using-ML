This is a code implementation for a binary classification problem to predict whether a client for a bank will subscribe to a term deposit or not. The dataset is taken from Kaggle, and PySpark is used to implement the solution.

The project has the following steps:

Importing the required libraries, setting up a Spark session, and reading the dataset.
Exploratory data analysis, including visualizing correlations among features.
Data preparation for machine learning, including encoding categorical features and assembling features into a single vector.
Creating a pipeline to apply transformations and build machine learning models.
Building different classification models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, and Gradient-Boosted Tree Classifier.
Evaluating the models using different metrics such as area under the ROC curve, precision, and recall.
Overall, this project demonstrates how to implement machine learning models using PySpark and how to evaluate the models using different metrics.
